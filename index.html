			As a Software Engineer at Amazon Web Services (AWS), I have had the opportunity to work on cutting-edge
			technology, creating innovative solutions for cloud computing and delivering highly-scalable and reliable
			software systems.<br />
			With a Master's degree in Computer Science from Northeastern University, I bring in-depth knowledge of the
			principles of software engineering, distributed systems, and algorithms to every project I undertake.<br />
			My passion for advancing the field of technology has led me to conduct research in the areas of machine
			learning and image processing and has been published in prominent academic journals.<br />
			I thrive in a fast-paced, collaborative environment and am always eager to learn and tackle new
			challenges.<br />
			I am dedicated to using my expertise to develop software that is scalable, efficient, and user-friendly.
